## basic-auth-app

This repository contains a basic implementation of an application that uses passwords, passkeys and biometric recognition. The application illustrates an example of how the registration, enrollment, login and account recovery can look like for general web-application logins. The application is built as a Python Flask application to allow a greater audience to review and understand how these systems work at a high level.
